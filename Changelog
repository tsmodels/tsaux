# 2021-07-08 v0.1.3 [AG]
- Added the auto_regressors function to the package for automatic detection
of outliers, trend breaks and temporary changes (wrapper for tso function of
tsoutliers package).
# 2021-04-20 v0.1.2 [AG]
- Added ability to have missing values in tslinear (and predict missingness) as
a requirements for implementing ETS with missing values (tslinear provides
starting values for the states).
- Replaced stl with stlplus to allow missing values for the multivariate
Box Cox transformation (which required deasonalized values).
- Added more checks for missing values in metrics.
- ToDo: add more checks in the metrics (e.g. crps) and weighted metrics
